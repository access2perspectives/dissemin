msgid "Dissemin uses ORCID's public OAuth interface to authenticate its users. This interface only transmits information marked as public in the user's ORCID profile. This means that ORCID passwords are never transmitted and email addresses are not transmitted when they are marked as private, which is the default setting. When logging in to Dissemin from ORCID, Dissemin acquires the user's ORCID id, as well as all public information attached to the ORCID record. We are using the <a href=\"https://sentry.io/privacy/\">Sentry service</a> for error tracking on this platform. Our webserver configuration stores basic access information (URL requested and IP address) for error monitoring, which are kept for fourteen days. Dissemin can store any information input by its users on the platform. Users can ask for a copy of the personal information Dissemin stores about them by writing an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@dissem.in\">support@dissem.in</a>."
