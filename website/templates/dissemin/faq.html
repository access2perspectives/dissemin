                    If the name matches but the paper is not in Dissemin, then maybe one of your co-authors asked us to delete it? Or it may be a bug.

Hence, please first check if the error that you have seen is already present in our data sources, by looking at the "Links" section in the top right of the page.

                    First, note that Dissemin does not account for copies of articles that are only available on a personal homepage or a similar website. This is deliberate, because we believe that <a href="#repositoriesRock">articles should be hosted in repositories</a>.

                    Second, at the moment, Dissemin only supports repositories with a crawlable API that follows the <a href="https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH protocol</a>, and is <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/suggest.php">registered</a> in <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE</a>. We have a <a href="https://github.com/dissemin/croawl">long-term project</a> to support more repositories by crawling them, but for the moment, we do not have the resources to support repositories not covered by BASE. Hence, if you are a user of a repository and would like it to be supported by Dissemin, please contact the repository administrator and suggest them to implement OAI-PMH support and to <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/suggest.php">register</a> their repository in BASE.

                    Authenticating users is necessary to deposit papers on their behalf in open repositories. Besides, knowing a user's ORCID id helps us find its publications, avoiding articles authored by namesakes for instance. Logging in via ORCID will not expose any private information to Dissemin: we only have access to the public part of your ORCID record. For instance, unless you have explicitly marked your email address as public, we do not even know your email address when you log in to Dissemin via ORCID.

                    Authentication with eduGAIN/Shibboleth only exposes to us the information that your identity provider is willing to transfer.

                    If your identity provider sends Dissemin an ORCID, there is no difference in functionality, except that for some institutional repositories we can confirm that you are a member of the owning instution of the repository if you authenticate with eduGAIN---which may accelerate the publication process in the repository.

                    If your identity provide does not transmit an ORCID, we can't associate your account with an ORCID profile.

                    ORCID supports various methods to claim publications. Our preferred one is via CrossRef's search interface. Here is how to use it:
                {% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>

                        Go to <a href="https://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef Metadata Search</a>;

                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Click "Log in" in the top right corner and go through the ORCID login process;
                    {% endblocktrans %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Search for your publications, for instance by typing your name in CrossRef's search interface;
                    {% endblocktrans %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Add publications that are yours to your ORCID record by clicking "Add to ORCID".
                    {% endblocktrans %}
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                    You can also add publications to your profile <em>on Dissemin</em>, by clicking the button "Include in my profile" in search results on Dissemin. (This button is only visible when you are logged in, and next to papers that Dissemin thinks you have authored.) You can also exclude articles from your profile in this way. Please note that these changes are local to Dissemin and are <em>not</em> propagated to your ORCID profile, because ORCID does not have a free API allowing us to propagate them.

                {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                If you change some details in your ORCID profile (name, homepage, etc.), the changes will not automatically be picked up in your profile on Dissemin. To update your profile on Dissemin accordingly, once you have logged in to Dissemin, you can go to your <a href="{{ profile_url }}">profile page</a> and click "Refresh publications".

                {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                    Based on the ORCID, Dissemin will automatically merge both accounts into one. This requires that your identity provider releases your ORCID. If your identity provider supports this functionality, you can add your ORCID in the user management of your identity provider.
